"""Signed-URL registry: undo model-side URL truncation before tools run.

Why this exists
---------------
image_generate / video_generate return pre-signed TOS URLs, e.g.
``https://ark-....volces.com/doubao-seedream-5-0-pro/.../x.jpeg?X-Tos-Algorithm=...&X-Tos-Signature=...``.
The signature lives in the query string, so the URL is only valid in full.
Despite the prompt forbidding it, models regularly copy such URLs into the
next tool call with the query string dropped or cut short (long opaque
strings are exactly what LLMs paraphrase), and TOS then answers ``403
Forbidden`` — which surfaces as a "permission" error in file_download or as
an image_generate/video_generate task failure.

What this does
--------------
* ``record_urls`` (an ``after_tool_callback``) walks every tool response and
  remembers each ``http(s)`` URL that carries a query string, keyed by
  ``scheme://host/path``.
* ``restore_urls`` (a ``before_tool_callback``) walks the arguments of the
  next tool call and, whenever it finds a stripped or truncated form of a
  recorded URL — as a bare argument, or embedded in a longer string such as
  a ``bash_tool`` command line or ``write_file_tool`` JSON content — replaces
  it in place with the recorded full URL. Unknown URLs are left untouched.

The registry is process-global and bounded; it only needs to survive for
the life of a session, and signed URLs expire within 24h anyway.
