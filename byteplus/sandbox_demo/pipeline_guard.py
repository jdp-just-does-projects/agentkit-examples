"""Auto-continue guard: keep a multi-step agent running until its job is done.

Why this exists
---------------
google-adk ends an agent's turn as soon as the model returns a response that
contains no function call (see ``Event.is_final_response``). Models driving a
multi-step tool pipeline fairly often narrate progress as a stand-alone,
text-only reply — "Here is the reference image, now generating the video!" or
"Step 5 complete, moving on to Step 6" — without issuing the next tool call in
that same response. The turn ends right there and the user has to type
"continue" to get the pipeline going again (or, inside an automated
multi-agent pipeline, a downstream agent receives an incomplete result).

What this does
--------------
* ``track_tool_use`` (an ``after_tool_callback``) records, per invocation,
  which tools the agent has actually called.
* ``auto_continue`` (an ``after_model_callback``) inspects every complete
  (non-partial) model response. If it contains no function call and the
  agent's job does not look finished, the callback appends a synthetic call
  to the ``continue_pipeline`` tool. That keeps the ADK loop alive: the tool
  result tells the model to carry on with the next step immediately.

"Finished" is decided by whichever of these you configure in ``install()``:

* ``required_tools`` — the reply is accepted once every listed tool has been
  called at least once during this invocation (e.g. ``{"video_generate"}``
  for an agent whose deliverable is a generated video).
* ``completion_markers`` — the reply is accepted if its visible text
  contains one of these strings (e.g. a final report heading). When only
  markers are configured the guard arms itself once the agent has called at
  least one tool in the invocation, so plain conversational replies are never
  nudged. When both are configured, both must hold.

In every mode a reply whose last line asks the user a question is accepted
(a genuine "I need your decision" pause), and the nudge is issued at most once
per text-only streak — if the model answers the nudge with another text-only
reply, that reply is accepted and the turn ends. A hard per-invocation cap is
a second safety net against loops.

The injected call/response pair is serialized like any other tool exchange:
an ``assistant`` message with ``tool_calls`` followed by a ``tool`` message
for OpenAI-compatible chat endpoints (LiteLlm), and ``function_call`` /
``function_call_output`` items for the Ark Responses API (ArkLlm) — verified
against ARK for both the cached (``previous_response_id``) and the replay
path. The id deliberately avoids ADK's ``adk-`` prefix, which ADK strips
before sending.

Usage
-----
    import pipeline_guard
    pipeline_guard.install(agent, required_tools={"video_generate"})

    # multi-agent trees: configure sub-agents by name
    pipeline_guard.install_by_name(root_agent, {
        "image_agent": {"required_tools": {"image_generate"}},
        "video_agent": {"required_tools": {"video_generate"}},
