# Sandbox Demo - Cloud Coding Agent

**IMPORTANT**: This demo was tested with Python 3.12, but other demos here require other versions of Python. We recommend installing and managing multiple versions of Python with [mise](https://mise.jdx.dev/getting-started.html).

This is a "Cloud Coding Agent" based on BytePlus AgentKit. It showcases the **AgentKit AIO Sandbox**: a secure, isolated cloud execution environment with a shell, file system, Python/Node.js runtimes, and outbound network access.

When given a web coding task (e.g. *"build a landing page with a countdown timer"*), the agent will:

- Plan the project and scaffold it **inside the AIO Sandbox** (never on the machine the agent runs on)
- Write every source file in the sandbox using shell commands
- **Test the code inside the sandbox**: syntax checks, unit tests, and actually serving the app and verifying it with `curl`
- Zip the finished project inside the sandbox
- Upload the zip **directly from the sandbox to TOS** using a presigned URL
- Return a signed TOS download link for the completed, tested code

## Overview

### Core Features

This use case demonstrates how to build an agent around the AgentKit sandbox with the following capabilities:

- **Isolated Code Execution**: All code is written and executed in a remote AIO Sandbox session via the veadk built-in `run_code` tool, which drives the sandbox through the AgentKit `InvokeTool` API. On BytePlus, everything runs through the `RunCode` operation: a persistent IPython kernel that also executes shell commands via `!` syntax.
- **Stateful Sandbox Sessions**: Sandbox sessions persist between tool calls, so the agent can scaffold, test, fix, and package a project across many steps — and iterate on the same project in follow-up turns.
- **Real Testing, Not Claims**: The agent starts a web server inside the sandbox, curls it, and asserts on the response before declaring the task done.
- **Credential-free Artifact Delivery**: The agent runtime generates a presigned TOS PUT/GET URL pair; the sandbox pushes the zip to TOS with plain `curl -T`. Cloud credentials never enter the sandbox.

The flow looks like this:

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

#### BytePlus Access Credentials

Make sure you have configured an IAM user, created a new Access Key / Secret Key pair, and that you have assigned the following permissions to the user:

- `AgentKitFullAccess` (AgentKit full access)
- `TOSFullAccess` (TOS full access, for presigned URL generation)

In the web console, open the product search dropdown and search for "ModelArk". Under "Model activation" make sure the following model is enabled:

- **Text:** DeepSeek V4 Pro (model ID: `deepseek-v4-pro-260425`)

**Finally, from the "API Keys" page, create a new key and save it, we'll need it later on (see *Configure Environment Variables* below).**

#### Create an AIO Sandbox Tool

The agent needs an **All-in-one (AIO) sandbox tool** in your AgentKit account. You can create one from the [BytePlus AgentKit Console](https://console.byteplus.com/agentkit/region:agentkit+ap-southeast-1/tool) (Tools → Create → AIO Sandbox), or programmatically.

After the tool is created, its tool ID (`t-...`) **must be exported as `AGENTKIT_TOOL_ID`** in the shell where you run the agent — the `run_code` tool resolves the sandbox from that variable at call time. The snippet below creates the tool and exports the variable in one step:

```bash
export BYTEPLUS_ACCESS_KEY={your_ak}
export BYTEPLUS_SECRET_KEY={your_sk}
export AGENTKIT_CLOUD_PROVIDER=byteplus

export AGENTKIT_TOOL_ID=$(uv run python - <<'EOF'
import sys
import uuid
from agentkit.sdk.tools.client import AgentkitToolsClient
from agentkit.sdk.tools import types as tt

resp = AgentkitToolsClient().create_tool(tt.CreateToolRequest(
    Name="sandbox_demo_aio",
    ToolType="All-in-one",
    Description="AIO sandbox for the sandbox_demo web coding agent",
    EnableSnapshot=True,
    AuthorizerConfiguration=tt.AuthorizerForCreateTool(
        KeyAuth=tt.AuthorizerKeyAuthForCreateTool(
            ApiKeyName=f"apikey_{uuid.uuid4().hex[:8]}",
            ApiKeyLocation="Header",
        )
    ),
))
print("Created sandbox tool:", resp.tool_id, file=sys.stderr)
# Only the tool ID goes to stdout, so the shell can capture it
print(resp.tool_id)
EOF
)
echo "AGENTKIT_TOOL_ID=$AGENTKIT_TOOL_ID"
```

`export` only affects the current shell session — when you open a new terminal, re-export the same tool ID (there is no need to create a new tool). You may want to add the `export AGENTKIT_TOOL_ID=t-...` line to your shell profile.

> **Snapshots** (`EnableSnapshot=True`): when a sandbox session's TTL expires, AgentKit takes a snapshot instead of discarding the instance; the next access to the same session transparently recreates the instance from the snapshot. For this agent that means a user can come back to a conversation hours later and the project files in `/tmp/workspace/` are still there. Snapshots can only be enabled at tool creation time — there is no update path, so if you have a non-snapshot tool you must recreate it.

> **Note**: The BytePlus AgentKit control plane currently supports only the `RunCode` operation for sandbox invocation (`ExecBash` returns `InvalidOperationType`). The agent is therefore instructed to do everything through the sandbox's persistent IPython kernel — Python code directly, shell commands via `!` syntax. The Volcano Engine copy of this demo uses `ExecBash` instead; that is the only functional difference between the two.

### Install Dependencies

*We recommend using uv to manage Python dependencies*

Once UV is installed, set up with:

```bash
uv sync
```

### Configure Environment Variables

Set the following environment variables — either export them in your shell, or copy [`.env.example`](.env.example) to `.env` (in the project directory or in the directory you launch from) and fill it in. `.env` is loaded automatically at startup (see [`consts.py`](consts.py)) and is optional; values in `.env` take precedence over variables exported in the shell, and anything missing from `.env` falls back to the shell environment. `.env` only applies to local runs — for cloud deploys pass values through `agentkit config --runtime_envs ...` (see below):

```bash
export BYTEPLUS_ACCESS_KEY={your_ak}
export BYTEPLUS_SECRET_KEY={your_sk}
export DATABASE_TOS_BUCKET=agentkit-platform-{{your_account_id}}
export MODEL_AGENT_API_KEY={{your_model_agent_api_key}} # Get from BytePlus ModelArk, required for local debugging
export AGENTKIT_TOOL_ID={{your_sandbox_tool_id}}        # Already set if you used the creation snippet above in this shell
export AGENTKIT_CLOUD_PROVIDER=byteplus
export CLOUD_PROVIDER=byteplus
```

**Note:** `AGENTKIT_CLOUD_PROVIDER` and `CLOUD_PROVIDER` are both **mandatory** — export them in every shell you run this sample from, and pass both through to the deployed runtime. `AGENTKIT_CLOUD_PROVIDER` is read by the agentkit SDK, while veADK reads `CLOUD_PROVIDER` — it controls veADK's default endpoints, models, and the mapping of `BYTEPLUS_*` credentials onto the `VOLCENGINE_*` variables veADK uses internally. Without them the SDKs fall back to their Volcano Engine (mainland China) defaults and calls against your BytePlus account fail. `consts.py` sets `CLOUD_PROVIDER=byteplus` as a last-resort fallback inside the agent process, but that does not cover the agentkit SDK or the tools when run standalone, so do not rely on it.

**TOS Bucket Configuration:**

- **Default bucket**: `agentkit-platform-{{your_account_id}}`
  - Where `{{your_account_id}}` needs to be replaced with your BytePlus account ID
  - Example: `DATABASE_TOS_BUCKET=agentkit-platform-12345678901234567890`
- **If you need to customize, you can modify the `bucket_name` parameter in [`tool/tos_presign.py`](tool/tos_presign.py) or pass it in during the tool call.**

## Local Execution

The simplest way to debug locally is with `veadk web`:

> `veadk web` is a web service based on FastAPI for debugging Agent applications. When you run this command, it starts a web server that loads and runs your agentkit agent code, while also providing a chat interface where you can interact with the agent. In the sidebar or a specific panel of the interface, you can view the details of the agent's execution, including the Thought Process, Tool calls, and model input/output.

Running it from within the project directory is straightforward:

```bash
uv run veadk web
```

Visit `http://localhost:8000` in your browser, select the `sandbox_demo` agent, enter a prompt, and click "Send".

### Example Prompts

- **Static page**: "Build a single-page countdown timer that counts down to New Year 2027"
- **Small game**: "Write a browser-based memory card matching game in plain HTML/CSS/JS"
- **API service**: "Write a Flask JSON API for a todo list, with unit tests"
- **Utility page**: "Build a markdown previewer web page with live rendering"
- **Follow-up iteration**: "Now add a dark mode toggle to it" (the agent reuses the same sandbox project)

**Expected Behavior:**

1. The agent restates the task and picks a project layout
2. Scaffolds and writes all files under `/tmp/workspace/<slug>/` in the AIO Sandbox
3. Runs syntax checks and tests, serves the app inside the sandbox, and curl-verifies it (you will see the real command output in the tool call results)
4. Zips the project and uploads it to TOS from inside the sandbox via a presigned URL
5. Returns a signed TOS download link, valid for 7 days

## AgentKit Deployment

### Deploy to BytePlus AgentKit Runtime

**Step 0:** If you haven't installed agentkit yet, you can do it locally (inside the Python virtual environment) with:

```bash
uv pip install agentkit-sdk-python
```

**Step 1:** Make sure you are in the current directory (`sandbox_demo`), then configure AgentKit:

**Note**: We assume here that `DATABASE_TOS_BUCKET`, `MODEL_AGENT_API_KEY`, and `AGENTKIT_TOOL_ID` are defined in your shell environment

```bash
uv run agentkit config \
--agent_name sandbox_web_coder \
--entry_point 'agent.py' \
--runtime_envs DATABASE_TOS_BUCKET=$DATABASE_TOS_BUCKET \
--runtime_envs MODEL_AGENT_API_KEY=$MODEL_AGENT_API_KEY \
--runtime_envs AGENTKIT_TOOL_ID=$AGENTKIT_TOOL_ID \
--runtime_envs AGENTKIT_CLOUD_PROVIDER=byteplus \
--runtime_envs CLOUD_PROVIDER=byteplus \
--launch_type cloud
```

**Step 2:** Deploy the runtime:

```bash
uv run agentkit launch
```

### Test the Deployed Agent

After successful deployment:

1. Visit the [BytePlus AgentKit Console](https://console.byteplus.com/agentkit/region:agentkit+ap-southeast-1/overview?projectName=default)
2. Click **Runtime** to view the deployed agent `sandbox_web_coder`
3. Get the public access domain name (e.g., `https://xxxxx.apigateway-ap-southeast-1.apigw-byteplus.com`) and API Key

#### Interact via the chat UI

The agent runtime includes a simple web UI (chat window) where you can interact directly with the agent.

#### Interact via the command line (CLI)

You can directly use `agentkit invoke` to trigger / debug the agent. The command is:

```bash
uv run agentkit invoke '{"prompt": "Build a single-page countdown timer that counts down to New Year 2027"}'
```

## Cleanup / Teardown

You can remove your deployed AgentKit runtime with:

```bash
uv run agentkit destroy
```

To also remove the AIO sandbox tool:

```bash
uv run agentkit sandbox delete --tool-id {{your_sandbox_tool_id}}
```

## Debugging tips

Having trouble understanding why AgentKit isn't doing what you expect? Try adding these environment variables to enable additional debug output:

```bash
export AGENTKIT_LOG_CONSOLE=true
export AGENTKIT_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

**`ValueError: The environment variable AGENTKIT_TOOL_ID not exists` when the agent calls run_code:** the shell running the agent has no `AGENTKIT_TOOL_ID` exported. Export the tool ID of your AIO sandbox tool (see *Create an AIO Sandbox Tool* above) and restart the agent.

**401 `AuthenticationError: The API key doesn't exist` on model calls:** the agent model is pinned to the BytePlus ModelArk endpoint in [`agent.yaml`](agent.yaml), so this usually means `MODEL_AGENT_API_KEY` holds a Volcano Engine Ark key (or an invalid key) rather than a BytePlus ModelArk key. Conversely, when running the *Volcano Engine* copy of this demo, make sure `CLOUD_PROVIDER`/`AGENTKIT_CLOUD_PROVIDER` are not set to `byteplus` in your shell.

## How the sandbox is used (implementation notes)

- The veadk built-in tool [`run_code`](https://github.com/volcengine/veadk-python) resolves the sandbox tool ID from `AGENTKIT_TOOL_ID` (or `AGENTKIT_TOOL_ID_SCRIPT`) and calls the AgentKit `InvokeTool` API. With `CLOUD_PROVIDER=byteplus`, the call goes to the BytePlus AgentKit endpoint (`agentkit.ap-southeast-1.bytepluses.com`). BytePlus supports the `RunCode` operation (`language: "python3"`, a persistent IPython kernel); the agent's instructions route shell commands through the kernel's `!` syntax because the `ExecBash` operation is not available on BytePlus.
- The sandbox session ID is derived from the agent name + user ID + ADK session ID, so each chat session gets its own isolated sandbox session, and files persist across tool calls within a session (session TTL is controlled by `AGENTKIT_TOOL_TTL`, default 1800s).
- The sandbox has outbound internet access but no cloud credentials. To get artifacts out, [`tool/tos_presign.py`](tool/tos_presign.py) generates a presigned PUT/GET URL pair on the agent side; the sandbox uploads with `curl -T` and the user receives the GET link.

## Known issues

- The first `run_code` call in a session may take noticeably longer than subsequent ones, since AgentKit provisions a fresh sandbox instance on demand (or restores it from a snapshot).
- Sandbox sessions expire after the TTL (default 30 minutes of inactivity, controlled by `AGENTKIT_TOOL_TTL`). With `EnableSnapshot=True` (as configured above) the session state is snapshotted on expiry and restored transparently on the next call, so project files survive. If you created the tool *without* snapshots, the files are gone after expiry and the agent must scaffold again.
