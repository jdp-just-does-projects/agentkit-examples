# for images), so a run without a `config.yaml` silently lands on very old
# models. veadk has already flattened `config.yaml` / `.env` into os.environ
# during its import above, so filling in defaults with setdefault here keeps
# the documented precedence: environment > config.yaml > these defaults.
# `settings.model` snapshotted its values before these defaults existed, so
# rebuild it afterwards; the sub-agents read it when `app` is imported below.
